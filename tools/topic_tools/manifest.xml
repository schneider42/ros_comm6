  <description brief="generic routing tools">
    Tools for directing, throttling, selecting, and otherwise messing with
    ROS topics at a meta level. None of the programs in this package actually
    know about the topics whose streams they are altering; instead, these
    tools deal with messages as generic binary blobs. This means they can be
    applied to any ROS topic.
